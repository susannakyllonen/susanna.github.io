                Former digital marketer with a newfound passion towards coding
              </h2>
              <p>
                Former Professional digital marketer learning news skills in the
                domain of frontend development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aspiring frontend developer, sports enthusiast and a mother of
                three inspiring kids. Many would say this combo is hard to
                manage; I have found that these three important areas of my life
                give to each other and enable me to be more effective whether
                I’m working on a new project or prioritizing and making
                decisions in fast-paced situations.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                During my career, I’ve worked in different fields ranging from
                manufacturing, retail sales & customer service to fashion
                design. In every position, I have been recognized of my
                resilience and customer centric attitude. While being at home
                2006-2012 when my three kids were small, I studied Marketing &
                Communication as it was the domain I wanted to work in and
                develop myself further.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                What currently inspires me is to develop myself in the field of
                software developent. What started a year ago as a spark ignited
                at the Rails Girls event has now grown into a urge and source of
                inspiration that keeps me attached to my keyboard and learn new
                every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those who know me say that I’m warm and empathic towards other
                people, always dependable and exceedingly interested in learning
                new things.
