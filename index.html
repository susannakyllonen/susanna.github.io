              <h2>
                Software developer & founder at Twig the Code
              </h2>
              <p>
                Hard-working software developer, sports enthusiast and a mother
                of three inspiring kids.
              </p>
              <p>
                Previously I have been working as a digital marketing
                professional in different companies ranging from small tech
                startups to large enterprise companies. Two years ago I felt
                that the world of marketing had given me all it could and at the
                same time I was inspired by the technical aspects that I had
                come across within my work. This introduced me to the world of
                software development and I fell in love almost instantly. I
                decided to leave the world of marketing and learn software
                development.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                During my journey to become a software developer, I found out
                that there are many other women like me who would like to enter
                the world of software development but due to the male-dominated
                environment and lack of support communities for women find it
                hard. I decided to do something for this and founded Twig the
                Code, a non-profit organization supporting aspiring female
                software developers on their way.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Twig the code organizes regular coding trainings, development
                camps, networking events for women and contracts on software
                development projects to customers. All this aims to help our
                members strengthen their skills in software development, build
                up their portfolio through real-life projects and get them
                familiar with the companies and people behind companies building
                software in Finland.
              </p>
              <p>
                Personally, during the two years I have learnt to work with
                JavaScript, React, Groovy, Python and done projects involving
                user interface and user experience development.
